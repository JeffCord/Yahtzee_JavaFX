# Yahtzee_JavaFX


Team Name:

Team Members: Nicholas Ray, Charlie Alvarado, Sabrina Ramon, Lauryn Hernandez, Jeffrey Cordes

Description: This app is a clone of the classic tabletop game, Yahtzee. It allows for 1-10 players on the same local device.

Known Bugs: The "Roll" button in the gameplay scene sometimes results in a delay because the app is loading the dice images, so be careful not to press that button until after the dice show up, or you could accidentally use one of your rolls for that turn without realizing it. Our save and exit functionality is also not implemented right now, even though we have save and load buttons in our app.

Versions or other requirements: Java 8, JavaFX
